# Getting Started

**Mess** is a utility-first CSS library built with TypeScript, designed to simplify styling components using dynamic breakpoints and easy-to-use utility functions. It allows you to create responsive, customizable styles based on user-configurable breakpoints and supports simple styling through semantic tags like `Button` , `Text` , `Image` , `Box` , `Input` , `Label` , `ul`,  `li` , `Footer` , `Form` and more.

## Installation
To install mess, you can use npm or yarn.
 ### npm
```bash
npm i mess
```
 ### yarn
```bash
yarn add mess
```
